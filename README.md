This project aims to explore and analyze topics from Arabic texts using the powerful BERTopic library. The project leverages the [saudinewsnet](https://huggingface.co/datasets/saudinewsnet) dataset to train the model and apply topic analysis.

## ðŸŒŸ Key Features

* **Text Preprocessing**: Includes a `clean_text` function for processing Arabic texts, which removes links, replaces numbers, standardizes spaces, and performs tokenization.
* **Advanced Topic Analysis**: Utilizes the BERTopic model to accurately and efficiently identify key topics within the dataset.
* **Model Saving and Reloading**: Allows you to easily save and reload the trained model for later use or to resume work.
